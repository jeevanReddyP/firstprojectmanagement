Organizing Tasks:
The "To Do" column will hold all the tasks we need to work on. When someone is ready to start a task, they’ll move it to the "In Progress" column.

Teamwork:
Each task will be assigned to a team member. When they start working on it, they move it to "In Progress". Once the task is finished, they move it to "Done". This way, everyone can see what’s being worked on and what’s completed.

Tracking Progress:
The project board helps us keep track of big goals. For example, if we’re working on the "User Authentication" feature, we can check if it’s still in progress or already done by looking at the board.

Visibility:
Everyone can see the project board, so we all know what’s happening. This keeps tasks from being forgotten.

Moving Tasks:
As tasks move forward, team members will move them between columns:

From "To Do" to "In Progress" when they start working.
From "In Progress" to "Done" when the task is finished.


Reflection on Project Management Tools:
Using GitHub’s project management tools—milestones, issues, and project boards—can really help a team stay organized and work better together. Milestones are great for breaking the project into smaller goals. For example, if we set a milestone for the “First Release,” the team knows exactly what needs to be done before that deadline, making it easier to track progress and stay on target.

Issues let you create tasks, report bugs, or request new features. By creating issues for specific tasks (like “Create login page” or “Fix bug in task management”), you can assign them to the right person, set a due date, and follow their progress. It helps everyone know what needs to be done and who is doing it.

Project boards give you a visual way to organize tasks. With columns like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done,” everyone can see which tasks are being worked on and what’s finished. This makes it clear where things stand and helps the team stay focused on what’s next.

The only challenge is keeping the board and issues updated. If people forget to move tasks or mark them complete, it can create confusion. Also, if the team doesn’t communicate well, some tasks might get overlooked. But, overall, using GitHub’s tools can help the team stay organized, track progress, and work more efficiently.
