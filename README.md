Organizing Tasks:
The "To Do" column will hold all the tasks we need to work on. When someone is ready to start a task, they’ll move it to the "In Progress" column.

Teamwork:
Each task will be assigned to a team member. When they start working on it, they move it to "In Progress". Once the task is finished, they move it to "Done". This way, everyone can see what’s being worked on and what’s completed.

Tracking Progress:
The project board helps us keep track of big goals. For example, if we’re working on the "User Authentication" feature, we can check if it’s still in progress or already done by looking at the board.

Visibility:
Everyone can see the project board, so we all know what’s happening. This keeps tasks from being forgotten.

Moving Tasks:
As tasks move forward, team members will move them between columns:

From "To Do" to "In Progress" when they start working.
From "In Progress" to "Done" when the task is finished.
